Usage
-----

Get https://github.com/jasonLaster/pry-bot and run its `pry-bot-demo`

Then you should be able to hit localhost:4567

Imagine
-------

- Getting instant feedback as you develop.

- Seeing all of the relevant components in one window

- Seeing how your code changes on the fly


Security
--------

TODO: Make sure we (by default) only allow localhost to connect to DRb (port
9000) and pry-mirror (4567).
